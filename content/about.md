The intended purpose of this website is a visual aid for creative projects – a “Moodboard” of things I like. That’s all.

This site was inspired by the wonderful Inspirations page over at [Zetto Plus](https://www.zetto.plus/inspirations). To browse my own inspirations here, visit the [#inspiration](/tags/inspiration/) page.

None of these images (unless stated) belong to me (Tomás González). If you own a particular image and would like it removed from the site please e-mail me and I will remove it as soon as possible. Under no circumstances will any of these images be used for commercial purposes.
